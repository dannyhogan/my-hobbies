        <img src="./assets/photoshop.png">
        <p>My interest in Graphic Design and Video Editing began back in my freshman year of highschool. I took a class on digital design not knowing what to expect, but ended up loving it. I was able to get certified in Adobe Photoshop, Premiere, and After Effects - All of which I use to this day.  </p>

        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <img src="./assets/gaming.jpg">
        <p>My young addiction began all thanks to a little box called the Nintendo64. Ever since I can remember, I have absolutely loved video games. From playing with family members, to playing with friends after school, video games have always been a past time that I find enjoyable.</p>
