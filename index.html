        <p>My interest in Graphic Design and Video Editing began back in my freshman year of highschool. I took a class on digital design not knowing what to expect, but ended up loving it. I was able to get certified in Adobe Photoshop, Premiere, and After Effects - All of which I use to this day.  </p>
